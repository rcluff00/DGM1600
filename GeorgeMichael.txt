I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind the silver screen and all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Thought it's easy to pretend, I know your not a fool
SHould've known better than to cheat a friend
Waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again the way I danced with you
