I looked out this morning, and the sun was gone
Turned on some music to start my day
Then lost myself in a familiar song
I close my eyes and I slipped away

(killer guitar riff)

It's more than a feelin' (more than a feelin')
When I hear that old song play (it's more than a feelin')
I begin dreamin' (more than a feelin')
Till I see Marianne walk away
I see my Marianne walking away

(killer guitar solo)
