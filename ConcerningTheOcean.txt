Concerning the Ocean:

It terrifies me. It terrifies me how little we know about it. Did you know that more than 75% of the planet we live on is covered by oceans, and we have explored less than 5% of the earth's oceans. I'm no good at math, but that's a very large chunk of the earth that we know nothing about. It terrifies me that sharks live in the ocean. And I know the stats on shark attacks or whatever. But they're still terrifying. And not just sharks, but whales bigger than school buses, and jellyfish that are smaller than your pinky that will kill you on accident, just by touching you. It terrifies me how big it is. It's like the opposite of claustrophibia. In conclusion, the ocean is terrifying.
