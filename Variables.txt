Variables are used in coding to hold information that can be changed by the code.
Different kinds of variables hold different kinds of information.
When you create a variable, it will always have a type, and you can either assign a value to it right away, or later in the code.

"int" variables hold integers, or whole numbers
"bool" variables hold boolean values, either true or false
"char" variables hold character values, such as "a" or "h"
"string" variables hold strings of characters, such as "scripting" or "the last jedi"
"float" variavles hold decimal numbers, such as "5.6" or "2.1"

Every piece of substantial code implements the use of variables.
